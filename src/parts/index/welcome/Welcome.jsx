              FlyBoy is a collection of 5,150 unique NFTs randomly stored on the
              Ethereum blockchain. Each bear is algorithmically generated by
              combining various traits. Your FlyBoy doubles as your access to
              the FlyBoysâ€™ Flying Club (FBFC), joining a family of NFT lovers
              who are avid travellers and aviators. FlyBoy is much more than just an avatar. 
              Physical and Virtual
              utilities have been planned, with the first physical utility being
              a personalised aviation tag of your own, from the famous
              Aviationtag.com.
